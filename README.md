- Exercise 1: Randomization - virtual coin toss program
- Exercise 2: Randomization + lists - bill Russian roulette
- Exercise 3: Nested lists - treasure map game
- Project: Rock paper scissors game (I went with an OOP solution)

- Challenge 1: First few steps in hangman game
- Challenge 2: Add support for a single user guess
- Challenge 3: Add loop to allow user to keep playing
- Challenge 4: Add support for user_lives mechanic

- Exercise 2: Functions with parameters - prime number checker
- Challenge 1: Caesar cipher - add `encrypt()` function

## Day 10: Functions with Outputs (2021/12/07)
- Exercise 1: Functions with outputs - days in specified month
- Project: Calculator program (with recursion :) )

## Day 11: Blackjack Capstone Project (2021/12/13)
- Going to use an OOP solution for this project too
- Spent a whole day on this, was surprisingly tricky
    + In particular, dealing with the ace being 1 or 11 took me a long time (even though the solution ended up being pretty simple)
- The `+=` syntax with lists is a shortcut for the `extend()` function.

## Day 12: Scoping (2021/12/10)
- Python scoping is weirder than I knew (no block scope)
- Use `global` keyword to to access global variables from local scopes
    + But usually not good to modify global variables from a non-global scope
- Project: Number guessing game

## Day 13: Debugging (2021/12/10)
- Exercise 0: Assorted debugging exercises
- Exercise 1: Debugging odd or even program
- Exercise 2: Debugging leap year program
- Exercise 3: Debugging FizzBuzz program

## Day 14: Higher Lower Game (2021/12/14)
- Skipping because no new concepts, don't need additional busywork.

## Day 15: Dev Environment Setup (2021/12/14)
- Skipping PyCharm stuff because already using IntelliJ with Python plug-in.
